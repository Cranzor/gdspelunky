# GDSpelunky

## Overview
GDSpelunky is a fan-made port of Spelunky Classic to the Godot game engine. The purpose of the project is to provide a modern and flexible version of the original game while prioritizing accuracy, ensuring that the overall experience is as close to the original as possible.

The original game and source code can be found [here](https://spelunkyworld.com/original.html).

## Features
- Frame rate settings (including uncapped)
- Variable aspect ratio support (including ultrawide)
- Controller rumble
- In-game control remapping
- Modding support

## Modding
GDSpelunky makes use of [Godot Mod Loader](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader) to provide modding support. This allows for running multiple mods at the same time. A few sample mods are included within the project.

## Current State
With this being the initial release of the project, note that there are some missing features and unresolved bugs. Some of the things I would like to work on going forward are:

- Level Editor (not yet implemented)
- Increased collision accuracy (collision system is currently a bit simplified)
- Classic pause menu setting + other accuracy settings
- Code documentation
- Better modding support and modding tutorials
- Further optimization to prevent drops in performance
- General bug and inaccuracy fixes

## Documentation
See the [Project Overview](/docs/overview.md) document to learn about the project structure.
