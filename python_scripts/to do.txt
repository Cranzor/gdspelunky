Things to go back and do

- Finish snap? GML function ---DONE
- Do parent scripts (like Item) and make sure they're running where they should
- Make sure TileMap objects get collision
- Have collision account for size properly
- Make a global script for holding every object so they can be instanced in wherever
- Check each object so far to see if it needs to run create or step events of parent
- Finish debug functions that were there for an object (oGame?)
- Implement instance_place
- See if it's possible to get an error when setting an animation that doesn't exist
- See if it's possible to set default AnimatedSprite2D animations to 30 fps
- Finish screen object
- Account for origin in sprite setup
